The goal of {SSVS} is to provide functions for performing stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) 
for binary and continuous outcomes and visualizing the results. 
SSVS is a Bayesian variable selection method used to estimate the probability 
that individual predictors should be included in a regression model. 
Using MCMC estimation, the method samples thousands of regression models 
in order to characterize the model uncertainty regarding both the predictor 
set and the regression parameters.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {SSVS} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("sabainter/SSVS")
```
## Example 1 - continuous response variable 

Consider a simple example using SSVS on the `mtcars` dataset to predict quarter mile times. We first specify
our response variable ("qsec"), then choose our predictors and run the `ssvs()` function.

```{r ssvs, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
library(SSVS)
outcome <- 'qsec'
predictors <- c('cyl', 'disp', 'hp', 'drat', 'wt',
 'vs', 'am', 'gear', 'carb','mpg')

results <- ssvs(data = mtcars, x = predictors, y = outcome, progress = FALSE)
```


The results can be summarized and printed using the `summary()` function. This will display both the MIP
for each predictor, as well as the probable range of values for each coefficient.

```{r summary, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
summary_results <- summary(results, interval = 0.9, ordered = TRUE)
```


```{r table, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(summary_results[, 1:6], align = 'lccccc', row.names = FALSE)
```

The MIPs for each predictor can then be visualized using the `plot()` function.

```{r plot, echo =TRUE}
plot(results)
```

## Example 2 - binary response variable 

In the example above, the response variable was a continuous variable. The same workflow can be used for binary variables by specifying `continuous = FALSE` to the `ssvs()` function.

As an example, let's create a binary variable:

```{r binary-data, echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(AER)
data(Affairs)
Affairs$hadaffair[Affairs$affairs > 0] <- 1
Affairs$hadaffair[Affairs$affairs == 0] <- 0
```

Then define the outcome and predictors.

```{r binary-vars, echo=TRUE}
outcome <- "hadaffair"
predictors <- c("gender", "age", "yearsmarried", "children", "religiousness", "education", "occupation", "rating")
```

And finally run the model:

```{r binary-run, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
results <- ssvs(data = Affairs, x = predictors, y = outcome, continuous = FALSE, progress = FALSE)
```

Now the results can be summarized or visualized in the same manner.

```{r binary-results, results='hide'}
summary_results <- summary(results, interval = 0.9, ordered = TRUE)
```

```{r binary-table, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(summary_results[, 1:6], align = 'lccccc', row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r binary-plot, echo =TRUE}
plot(results)
```

## Interactive version

You can launch an interactive (shiny) web application that lets you run SSVS analyses without programming. Simply install this package and run `SSVS::launch()` in an R console.
